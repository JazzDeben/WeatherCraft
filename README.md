# WeatherCraft
Code for my minecraft weather station.

## Project Overview
The idea is to create a mini weather station with a raspberry pi and use it to modify the environment in a Minecraft server. the idea is to move a raspberry pi outside and use the input from sensors to send API calls to modify the environment in Minecraft.

## Target Features
This project currently has two target features:

### Day/Night switch
Day and night in Minecraft will be set by a light sensor

### Weather flicker
Rain and clear weather will be changed in the minecraft server through API calls triggered by the input from a rain sensor.

## Current Status
Currently, the project is shaping up, but it is not finished. The project uses 2 raspberry pis, one Mobel B which is going to be used as the weather station, and a model 2 (the quad core one) which runs the minecraft server. Finally, one needs a client which is to be purchased from the Minecraft web site.

So, all the details are going to be provided gradually. As the project gets through to completion.

## Next steps
Well, depending on how things go, there might be new features to be added, but, this will be reviewed at a later date
